Seed dropping mechanism:

It consists of 2 mini DC motors, 1 dual motor driver TB6612FNG, 3d printed parts: 2 seed capsule tanks, 2 gears, 2 flat gears.



Working principle: 

Seeds is contained in seed capsule tanks on the both sides of quadcopter, motors are connected on down side of seed capsule tank,
gears are connected to motors and flat gears (they at first close the capsule tank),
flat gears are hold by gears so when motor moves, flat gears slide and open capsule tank, so seeds will drop.

Motors are connected to motor driver, motor driver is connected to Quadcopter's Raspberry Pi 4 B.
