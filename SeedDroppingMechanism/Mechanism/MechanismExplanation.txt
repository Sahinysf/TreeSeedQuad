Seed dropping mechanism:

It consists of 2 mini DC motors, 1 dual motor driver TB6612FNG, 3d printed parts: 2 seed capsule tanks, 2 gears, 2 flat gears.

In "Mechanism" folder you can find: 
    PCB_design.png - PCB design for motor driver and T-blocks. T-blocks so wires can be easily connected and disconnected from it.
    Schematic.png - it is a circuit and connections of pins of motor driver with motors, Raspberry Pi 4B GPIO pins 
                    and external voltage for Motors - 5 V from Power Distribution Board of Clever 4 Quadcopter.
    gear1.stl - 3d model of gear for printing.
    gear2.stl - 3d model of flat gear for printing.


Working principle: 

Seeds are contained in seed capsule tanks on the both sides of quadcopter, motors are connected on down side of seed capsule tank,
gears are connected to motors and flat gears, which at first close the capsule tank,
flat gear is hold by gear, so when motor moves, flat gear slides and opens capsule tank, so seeds will drop.

Motors are connected to motor driver, motor driver is connected to Quadcopter's Raspberry Pi 4B.

The system is controlled by code written in Python language on Raspberry Pi 4B
